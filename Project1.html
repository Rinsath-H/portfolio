         <p>The rapid pace of industrialization has undeniably contributed to economic growth, employment generation, and technological advancement. However, it has also brought significant environmental consequences. One of the major concerns is industrial pollution, which includes emissions of harmful gases, particulate matter, and discharge of toxic substances into water bodies and soil. These pollutants pose a severe risk to human health, biodiversity, and overall ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Traditionally, pollution monitoring has relied on manual data collection and laboratory analysis, which are often time-consuming, infrequent, and prone to errors. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is an opportunity to revolutionize environmental monitoring by automating data collection, enabling real-time analysis, and facilitating timely decision-making.</p>
<p>An IoT-based Industrial Pollution Monitoring System uses embedded sensors, wireless communication, and cloud computing to monitor and report pollution levels in real-time. These systems can detect gases such as CO₂, CO, SO₂, NOx, and particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), and transmit data to a central server or cloud platform for analysis and visualization. The integration of such systems can help industries comply with environmental regulations, avoid penalties, and contribute to sustainable development.</p>

     <ul>
        <li>Now a day's environmental pollution becomes important issues in metropolitan cities and industries. The sudden growth of industries, infrastructure and transport vehicles have been producing environmental issues which directly effect on human's health and thus needs a special monitoring system. 
        </li>
        <li>To resolve have an effect on the environmental pollution issues, here we have a tendency to implement IoT based pollution monitoring and control system. Where it detects the deleterious gases present in the environment. The proposed IoT technology scrutinizes level of co gases released during industry process, temperature and PH using sensor technology and Arduino and LCD
         </li>
        <li>Each process will have a separate data monitoring and controlling mechanism. The device are going to be put in through a  mobile application which is able to show the live updates of the environmental pollution level of the industries or remote space The thought of IOT helps to access knowledge from remote locations.
        </li>
        <li>The most plans behind the implementation work is to form a true time absolutely machine-controlled management mechanisms exploitation IoT.

        <ul>
            <li>The classical way to detect industrial pollution is Labview and SCADA.Air Pollution in India has become an alarming problem in current day scenario. The pollution levels have increased to such an extent that it has already started showing adverse effects on the human life and other living organisms. 
           </li>
           <li>We have developed Pollution Monitoring System based on two strategies that will measure the level of harmful gases such as CO2, CO, smoke along with humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment. One of the two methods involves use of GSM which enables the user to monitor the pollution levels remotely.</li>
           <li>The system includes essential components to measure the parameters such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, smoke level, humidity and temperature in the surrounding area of the system.</li>
           <li>Another method developed uses LabVIEW, where the pollution levels can be monitored automatically with the help of sensors.
